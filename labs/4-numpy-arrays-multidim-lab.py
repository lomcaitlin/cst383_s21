# update df so that the two rightmost columns are the data in array ec

# print the mean value of all the scores

# print the number of scores > 2  (np.sum applied to a boolean mask will
# give the number of True values in the mask))

# using a list comprehension, compute the total score for each student
# and assign the result to variable 'totals' as a NumPy array

# print the dtype of totals; it should be int64

# assign the number of columns to variable 'num_problems'

# using a list comprehension, compute the average score for each
# problem and assign the result to variable 'prob_means' as a NumPy array

# what is the lowest of the average score values?

# Is it legal to subtract an array with shape (35,) from an
# array with shape (50,35)?  If so, what will happen?  Write
# your answer as a comment.

# the array (35,) will become (1,35), and will be subtracted
# from each row of the (50,35) array

# compute a new array df_centered, which is a 2D array with
# the same shape as df, but contains, for each column, the
# column values minus the average value for each column.

# What do you expect as the average values of the columns of
# dat_centered?  Print the result to find out.

# consider extending idea about length of student trips, but make a matrix,
# where each row is a student, and 'mpg', 'miles' are columns.  In a separate
# array, show prices of gas at several gas stations.
